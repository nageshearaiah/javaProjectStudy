Acknowledgements</H2>
<DIV ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Carmina Md BT" SIZE=3 COLOR="Black">First
of all, thanks to the Doyle Street Cohousing Community for putting up with me
for the two years that it took me to write this book (and for putting up with
me at all). Thanks very much to Kevin and Sonda Donovan for subletting their
great place in gorgeous Crested Butte, Colorado for the summer while I worked
on the book. Also thanks to the friendly residents of Crested Butte and the
Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory who made me feel so welcome. The World Gym
in Emeryville and its enthusiastic staff helped keep me sane during the final
months of the book.

is my first experience using an agent, and I&#8217;m not looking back. Thanks
to Claudette Moore at Moore Literary Agency for her tremendous patience and
perseverance in getting me exactly what I wanted.
</FONT><P></DIV><DIV ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Carmina Md BT" SIZE=3 COLOR="Black">My
first two books were published with Jeff Pepper as editor at
Osborne/McGraw-Hill. Jeff appeared at the right place and the right time at
Prentice-Hall and has cleared the path and made all the right things happen to
make this the most pleasant publishing experience I&#8217;ve ever had. Thanks,
Jeff &#8211; it means a lot to me.

especially indebted to Gen Kiyooka and his company Digigami, who have
graciously provided my Web server, and to Scott Callaway who has maintained it.
This has been an invaluable aid while I was learning about the Web.

to people who have spoken in my Java track at the Software Development
Conference, and students in my seminars, who ask the questions I need to hear
in order to make the material more clear.

thanks to Larry and Tina O&#8217;Brien, who turned this book and my seminar
into a teaching CD ROM. (You can find out more at

of people sent in corrections and I am indebted to them all, but particular
thanks go to: Kevin Raulerson (found tons of great bugs), Bob Resendes (simply
incredible), John Pinto, Joe Dante, Joe Sharp (all three were fabulous), David
Combs (many grammar and clarification corrections), Dr. Robert Stephenson,

Ir. Marc Meurrens put in a great deal of effort to publicize and make the book
available in Europe.
</FONT><P></DIV><DIV ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Carmina Md BT" SIZE=3 COLOR="Black">There
have been a spate of smart technical people in my life who have become friends
and have also been both influential and unusual in that they&#8217;re
vegetarians, do yoga and practice other forms of spiritual enhancement, which I
find quite inspirational and instructional. They are Kraig Brockschmidt, Gen
Kiyooka and Andrea Provaglio, who helps in the understanding of Java and
programming in general in Italy.
</FONT><P></DIV><DIV ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Carmina Md BT" SIZE=3 COLOR="Black">It&#8217;s
not that much of a surprise to me that understanding Delphi helped me
understand Java, since there are many concepts and language design decisions in
common. My Delphi friends provided assistance by helping me gain insight into
that marvelous programming environment. They are Marco Cantu (another Italian
&#8211; perhaps being steeped in Latin gives one aptitude for programming
languages?), Neil Rubenking (who used to do the yoga/vegetarian/Zen thing but
discovered computers) and of course Zack Urlocker, a long-time pal whom
I&#8217;ve traveled the world with.
</FONT><P></DIV><DIV ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Carmina Md BT" SIZE=3 COLOR="Black">My
friend Richard Hale Shaw&#8217;s insights and support have been very helpful
(and Kim&#8217;s, too). Richard and I spent many months giving seminars
together and trying to work out the perfect learning experience for the
attendees. Thanks also to KoAnn Vikoren, Eric Faurot, Deborah Sommers, Julie
Shaw, Nicole Freeman, Cindy Blair, Barbara Hanscome, Regina Ridley, Alex Dunne,
and the rest of the cast and crew at MFI.

book design, cover design, and cover photo were created by my friend Daniel
Will-Harris, noted author and designer (

who used to play with rub-on letters in junior high school while he awaited the
invention of computers and desktop publishing, and complained of me mumbling
over my algebra problems. However, I produced the camera-ready pages myself, so
the typesetting errors are mine. Microsoft
