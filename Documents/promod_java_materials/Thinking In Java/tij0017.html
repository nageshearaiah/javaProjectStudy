has object-oriented programming had such a sweeping impact on the software
development community?

programming appeals at multiple levels. For managers, it promises faster and
cheaper development and maintenance. For analysts and designers, the modeling
process becomes simpler and produces a clear, manageable design. For
programmers, the elegance and clarity of the object model and the power of
object-oriented tools and libraries makes programming a much more pleasant
task, and programmers experience an increase in productivity. Everybody wins,
it would seem.

there&#8217;s a downside, it is the expense of the learning curve. Thinking in
objects is a dramatic departure from thinking procedurally, and the process of <A NAME="Index30"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Carmina Md BT" SIZE=3 COLOR="Black"><I>designing</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Carmina Md BT" SIZE=3 COLOR="Black">

job of most programmers is to use existing objects to solve their application

programming is and how simple it can be.

chapter will introduce many of the ideas of Java and object-oriented
programming on a conceptual level, but keep in mind that you&#8217;re not
expected to be able to write full-fledged Java programs after reading this
chapter. All the detailed descriptions and examples will follow throughout the
course of this book.
