Summary</H2>
<DIV ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Carmina Md BT" SIZE=3 COLOR="Black">In
this chapter you have seen enough of Java programming to understand how to
write a simple program, and you have gotten an overview of the language and
some of its basic ideas. However, the examples so far have all been of the form
&#8220;do this, then do that, then do something else.&#8221; What if you want
the program to make choices, such as &#8220;if the result of doing this is red,
do that, if not, then do something else&#8221;? The support in Java for this
fundamental programming activity will be covered in the next chapter.
