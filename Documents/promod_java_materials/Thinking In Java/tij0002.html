Foreword</H1>
<DIV ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=4 COLOR="Black">I
suggested to my brother Todd, who is making the leap from hardware into
programming, that the next big revolution will be in genetic engineering.
</FONT><P></DIV><DIV ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Carmina Md BT" SIZE=3 COLOR="Black">We&#8217;ll
have microbes designed to make food, fuel and plastic; they&#8217;ll clean up
pollution and in general allow us to master the manipulation of the physical
world for a fraction of what it costs now. I claimed that it would make the
computer revolution look small in comparison. 
</FONT><P></DIV><DIV ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Carmina Md BT" SIZE=3 COLOR="Black">Then
I realized I was making a mistake common to science fiction writers: getting
lost in the technology (which is of course easy to do in science fiction). An
experienced writer knows that the story is never about the things; it&#8217;s
about the people. Genetics will have a very large impact on our lives, but
I&#8217;m not so sure it will dwarf the computer revolution &#8211; or at least
the information revolution. Information is about talking to each other: yes,
cars and shoes and especially genetic cures are important, but in the end those
are just trappings. What truly matters is how we relate to the world. And so
much of that is about communication.
</FONT><P></DIV><DIV ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Carmina Md BT" SIZE=3 COLOR="Black">This
book is a case in point. A majority of folks thought I was very bold or a
little crazy to put the entire thing up on the Web. &#8220;Why would anyone buy
it?&#8221; they asked. If I had been of a more conservative nature I
wouldn&#8217;t have done it, but I really didn&#8217;t want to write another
computer book in the same old way. I didn&#8217;t know what would happen but it
turned out to be the smartest thing I&#8217;ve ever done with a book.
</FONT><P></DIV><DIV ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Carmina Md BT" SIZE=3 COLOR="Black">For
one thing, people started sending in corrections. This has been an amazing
process, because folks have looked into every nook and cranny and caught both
technical and grammatical errors, and I&#8217;ve been able to eliminate bugs of
all sorts that I know would have otherwise slipped through. People have been
simply terrific about this, very often saying &#8220;Now, I don&#8217;t mean
this in a critical way&#8221; and then giving me a collection of errors
I&#8217;m sure I never would have found. I feel like this has been a kind of
group process and it has really made the book into something special.
</FONT><P></DIV><DIV ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Carmina Md BT" SIZE=3 COLOR="Black">But
then I started hearing &#8220;OK, fine, it&#8217;s nice you&#8217;ve put up an
electronic version, but I want a printed and bound copy from a real
publisher.&#8221; I tried very hard to make it easy for everyone to print it
out in a nice looking format but it didn&#8217;t stem the demand for the
published book. Most people don&#8217;t want to read the entire book on screen,
and hauling around a sheaf of papers, no matter how nicely printed,
didn&#8217;t appeal to them either (plus I think it&#8217;s not so cheap in
terms of laser printer toner). It seems that the computer revolution
won&#8217;t put publishers out of business, after all. However, one student
suggested this may become a model for future publishing: books will be
published on the Web first, and only if sufficient interest warrants it will
the book be put on paper. Currently, the great majority of books of all kinds
are financial failures, and perhaps this new approach could make the publishing
industry more profitable.
</FONT><P></DIV><DIV ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Carmina Md BT" SIZE=3 COLOR="Black">This
book became an enlightening experience for me in another way. I originally
approached Java as &#8220;just another programming language,&#8221; which in
many senses it is. But as time passed and I studied it more deeply, I began to
see that the fundamental intention of the language is different than in all the
other languages I have seen.
</FONT><P></DIV><DIV ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Carmina Md BT" SIZE=3 COLOR="Black">Programming
is about managing complexity: the complexity of the problem you want to solve
laid upon the complexity of the machine in which it is solved. Because of this
complexity, most of our programming projects fail. And yet of all the
programming languages that I am aware, none of them have gone all out and
decided that their main design goal would be to conquer the complexity of
developing and maintaining programs. Of course, many language design decisions
were made with complexity in mind, but at some point there were always some
other issues that were considered essential to be added into the mix.
Inevitably, those other issues are what causes programmers to eventually
&#8220;hit the wall&#8221; with that language. For example, C++ had to be
backwards-compatible with C (to allow easy migration for C programmers), as
well as efficient. Those are both very useful goals and account for much of the
success of C++, but they also expose extra complexity that prevents some
projects from being finished (certainly, you can blame programmers and
management, but if a language can help by catching your mistakes, why
shouldn&#8217;t it?). As another example, Visual Basic (VB) was tied to BASIC,
which wasn&#8217;t really designed to be an extensible language, so all the
extensions piled upon VB have produced some truly horrible and un-maintainable
syntax. On the other hand, C++, VB and other languages like Smalltalk had some
of their design efforts focused on the issue of complexity and as a result are
remarkably successful in solving certain types of problems.
</FONT><P></DIV><DIV ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Carmina Md BT" SIZE=3 COLOR="Black">What
has impressed me most as I have come to understand Java is what seems like an
unflinching goal of reducing complexity 
</FONT><FONT FACE="Carmina Md BT" SIZE=3 COLOR="Black"><I>for
the programmer
</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Carmina Md BT" SIZE=3 COLOR="Black">.
As if to say &#8220;we don&#8217;t care about anything except reducing the time
and difficulty of producing robust code.&#8221; In the early days, this goal
has resulted in code that doesn&#8217;t run very fast (although there have been
many promises made about how quickly Java will someday run) but it has indeed
produced amazing reductions in development time; half or less of the time that
it takes to create an equivalent C++ program. This result alone can save
incredible amounts of time and money, but Java doesn&#8217;t stop there. It
goes on to wrap all the complex tasks that have become important, such as
multithreading and network programming, in language features or libraries that
can at times make those tasks trivial. And finally, it tackles some really big
complexity problems: cross-platform programs, dynamic code changes, and even
security, each of which can fit on your complexity spectrum anywhere from
&#8220;impediment&#8221; to &#8220;show-stopper.&#8221; So despite the
performance problems we&#8217;ve seen, the promise of Java is tremendous: it
can make us significantly more productive programmers.
</FONT><P></DIV><DIV ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Carmina Md BT" SIZE=3 COLOR="Black">One
of the places I see the greatest impact for this is on the Web. Network
programming has always been hard, and Java makes it easy (and they&#8217;re
working on making it easier all the time). Network programming is how we talk
to each other more effectively and cheaply than we ever have with telephones
(email alone has revolutionized many businesses). As we talk to each other
more, amazing things begin to happen, possibly more amazing even than the
promise of genetic engineering.
</FONT><P></DIV><DIV ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Carmina Md BT" SIZE=3 COLOR="Black">In
all ways: creating the programs, working in teams to create the programs,
building user interfaces so the programs can communicate with the user, running
the programs on different types of machines, and easily writing programs that
communicate across the Internet &#8211; Java increases the communication
bandwidth 
</FONT><FONT FACE="Carmina Md BT" SIZE=3 COLOR="Black"><I>between
people
</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Carmina Md BT" SIZE=3 COLOR="Black">.
And I think that perhaps the results of the communication revolution will not
be seen from the effects of moving large quantities of bits around. We shall
see the true revolution because we will all be able to talk to each other more
easily &#8211; one-on-one, but also in groups and as a planet. I've heard it
suggested that the next revolution is the formation of a kind of global mind
which results from enough people and enough interconnectedness. Java may or may
not be the tool that foments that revolution, but at least the possibility has
made me feel like I'm doing something meaningful here by attempting to teach
the language.
